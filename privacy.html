  <h1>Privacy Policy – Hold This</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 4, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Camera Use</h2>
  <p>
    The app may request access to the front-facing camera on your device to take a selfie at the moment you drop the box. 
    This selfie is temporarily used to generate a fun image showing your result, with a humorous overlay.
    The selfie is saved locally on the device and is overwritten each time a new one is taken.
    The image is not uploaded or shared automatically in any way.
    You may choose to share the image manually, and doing so is entirely at your own discretion.
    This feature can be disabled at any time in the app’s options menu.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Google Play Leaderboard</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses Google Play Games Services to upload your score and allow you to compare results with players around the world.
    Your Google Play profile nickname and your score are visible on the public leaderboard.
    This feature is optional and can be disabled in the app’s options menu.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Ads and Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app displays <strong>only non-personalized ads</strong> through Google AdMob. 
    This means that no personal data is collected or used for ad targeting.
    We respect your privacy and do not require consent for ads in this app.
    Ads can be removed at any time by purchasing the in-app <em>"Remove Ads"</em> option.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Other than the features mentioned above, the app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
    We do not track user activity, location, or behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact the developer via the feedback option in the Google Play test program, or by email if provided.
